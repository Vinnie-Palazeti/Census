Put variables in pkl file?

Create package with functions

So retrieve is an example, it should pull the function from Censusdata.ACS.file import ...

Use that function to return the data bing bang boom

I need to identify all of the variables I think are important

Total population,
Skews & averages should be in paid version
Race Demographics
Black, white, hispanic, asian, etc
Sex demographics
Age
Skews young, old, etc

Social economic
Median income
Poverty

I want aggregate tables, so everything, say, within 25 miles of the gps coordinate input

County by county data is only necessary for mapping the counties, which would be cool to do 
For visualizations


I think breaking it down by Race - Age is too much

Really just want age break down, not race by age
