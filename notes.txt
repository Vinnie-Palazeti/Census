Currently have leaflet working

Can create geojson with python & use that in html + leaflet to create plot

Need to figure out how to format leaflet hover over stuff. I want there to be one big boarder of the  entire area, then the hover will show the census tract

When hover overing over a census tract only some of the stats will appear, need to choose which
	And need to format with control

Need interactive plots for below maps. Thats where the majority of the information will be shown

All variables displayed, Comparison to US as a whole, Google Trends, 
	Should this be done in python or in JS?

Get Node working with leaflet
Transfer GEO Json to leaflet thing

Figureout how that would work wit Ghost









**** Updated Updated Plan *****


Now that I have a layout of the land, seems like an easy procedure

procedure:

1.) Coordinate Input
2.) sjoin with country to find state, then sjoin with state to find county
3.) create shape with point, return all census tracts within that shape
4.) query database for tract data

At this point you have the tract data & the shape of the tracts. You need to turn the pandas frame into a geojson.

Here you can use leaflet or folium, which is a python wrapper

The geojson shapes are overlaid on the map




GOALS:

Finish & refine steps 1 - 4
Not only pull the data but document the steps & make it reproducible
Also figure out the point to shape to join issue you had originally







*** Updated plan ***

See if you can save / pickle the geopnadas file & put it up on GitHub

Just store it on a private github for now

**** Have a base version, just need a loop for the state codes & need to clean up/standardize storage

Just put it all in the db folder 







I should write a bash .sh file to rip all this shit

No need for python & requests

That sounds fun


Need to make sure what I am reading in. That when I download the files & get them into sql I have what I need when I pull them back out



I need to identify all of the variables I think are important

Total population,
Skews & averages should be in paid version
Race Demographics
Black, white, hispanic, asian, etc
Sex demographics
Age
Skews young, old, etc

Social economic
Median income
Poverty

I want aggregate tables, so everything, say, within 25 miles of the gps coordinate input

County by county data is only necessary for mapping the counties, which would be cool to do 
For visualizations


Can only call 50 vars at a time. Really need a solution to this AGE thing. -- since it has to be treated differently, I.e. it has to be summed, maybe put it in a different function. Call main get_data() then merge it with get_age() then shoot it into db
Or just put it in a different call.


I need the ability to find a gps location. I would rather not rely on other peoples APIS because what if it breaks

Might be better if I pull the shape files,
But then I have to do a join with the entire table, which might be slow

I should start a notebook so I don't have to keep all this in my head


I think I could simplify this by first doing it on the states, then doing it on the state selected (it might not be slow)
