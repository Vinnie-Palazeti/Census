I need to identify all of the variables I think are important

Total population,
Skews & averages should be in paid version
Race Demographics
Black, white, hispanic, asian, etc
Sex demographics
Age
Skews young, old, etc

Social economic
Median income
Poverty

I want aggregate tables, so everything, say, within 25 miles of the gps coordinate input

County by county data is only necessary for mapping the counties, which would be cool to do 
For visualizations


Can only call 50 vars at a time. Really need a solution to this AGE thing. -- since it has to be treated differently, I.e. it has to be summed, maybe put it in a different function. Call main get_data() then merge it with get_age() then shoot it into db
Or just put it in a different call.


I need the ability to find a gps location. I would rather not rely on other peoples APIS because what if it breaks

Might be better if I pull the shape files,
But then I have to do a join with the entire table, which might be slow

I should start a notebook so I don't have to keep all this in my head
