Put variables in pkl file?

Create package with functions

So retrieve is an example, it should pull the function from Censusdata.ACS.file import ...

Use that function to return the data bing bang boom

I need to identify all of the variables I think are important

Total population,
Skews & averages should be in paid version
Race Demographics
Black, white, hispanic, asian, etc
Sex demographics
Age
Skews young, old, etc

Social economic
Median income
Poverty

I want aggregate tables, so everything, say, within 25 miles of the gps coordinate input

County by county data is only necessary for mapping the counties, which would be cool to do 
For visualizations


### Goal is to get a function working with ACS

Really all I need to do is provide a list of items to variable, and should be good to go


Can only call 50 vars at a time. Really need a solution to this AGE thing. -- since it has to be treated differently, I.e. it has to be summed, maybe put it in a different function. Call main get_data() then merge it with get_age() then shoot it into db
Or just put it in a different call.
